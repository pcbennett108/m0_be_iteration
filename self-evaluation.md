# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

*You can perform a function on a whole range of elements with just a few lines of code.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

*I know there is a way to use an inline code block but have not tried that yet. Find an example online and experiment.*

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

*Trying all of the examples as written and then experimenting, asking 'what if?' and trying vsristions of the code.*
